# EAPI script to remotely edit an access list across multiple 
# Arista switches using your editor of choice.

# From a central server with IP connectivity to your switch, run this 
# script and specify an ACL name and a series of switches you are 
# interested in editing. This then opens your $EDITOR (e.g. vi or emacs)
# with the contents of the named ACL. When you're finished, close the file
# and this script will update that ACL across all of the switches you specified.
# No more dealing with annoying line numbers in the CLI!
